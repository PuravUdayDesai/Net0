# Net0: P2P Energy Market

An Energy trading platform where renewable energy gets traded between the producers and consumers without intermediate entities in a distributed environment using blockchain.

# Problem Statement
- Develop a P2P energy trading platform using blockchain.</li>
- Minimize financial and environmental costs using smart contracts.</li>
- Develop a decentralized, secure, and efficient P2P energy trading market that enables individuals and communities to generate and trade energy directly.</li>

# Conclusion
Our P2P energy trading platform using blockchain is still in the development phase. As such, we have not yet had the opportunity to run simulations to test and validate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture. However, we have conducted extensive research and analysis to ensure that our proposed design meets the requirements of a successful P2P energy trading platform. As we continue ​to develop and refine our platform, we plan to conduct simulations to validate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture and showcase its potential benefits on second stage of the report .​
